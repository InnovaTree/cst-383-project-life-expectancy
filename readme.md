# CST 383 - Introduction to Data Science

- Professor: Dr. Memo Ergezer
- TA: Joshua Gonzales

**Course Description:**

> In data science, data analysis and machine learning techniques are applied to visualize data, understand trends, and make predictions. In this course, students will learn how to obtain data, preprocess it, apply machine learning methods, and visualize the results. A student who completes the course will have enough theoretical knowledge, and enough skill with modern statistical programming languages and their libraries, to define and perform complete data science projects.

## **Project Description:**

> "At this moment, we want to identify the variables that affect life expectancy and to what extent. As we continue with the course, we may narrow our focus as we learn what is achievable with our level of knowledge and within the allotted time frame."

**[UPDATE]** | _02-06_ | - Prof. Memo:
> Hello Team,
> 
> Thanks for your project proposal. Below are some initial comments on your idea:
> 
> This dataset should be well within the scope of your class. It also seems to present a lot of different data types and analysis opportunities.
For your project update, you can start analyzing the features and creating visualizations.
> 
> In terms of model design/prediction, you need to start thinking about what features to use and what to use for training. For instance, you may be able to drop the country names from your final training dataset. We can discuss more later.
> 
> Please reach out to us with any comments or questions!

We could potentially turn this into a classification project if we create categories for certain life expectancy values (such as low, med, high). This link also contains sample student projects for reference.
